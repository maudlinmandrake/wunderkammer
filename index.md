_Die Wunderkammer_: A "wonder room", a "cabinet of wonders", or "cabinet of curiosities". Whatever you want to call it, it's a fancy way of saying a room or cabinet full of cool junk. Wikipedia sez:

She lives in Indianapolis with her husband, her daughter, and their orange tabby, Mochi. She works as a classroom assistant for an elementary Montessori classroom, grew up on the Internet, dropped out of art school, and prefers books over the company of people.' %}. I will ramble on about, in particular order, things like: self-led learning, unschooling and other forms of alternative schooling for kids, parenting, books & the art of reading, philosophy, creativity, and pretending to be a writer, among other things. I don't know if you'll like it here, and truthfully I write better if I think no one is watching. Go ahead and crack open the doors, but do it quietly...

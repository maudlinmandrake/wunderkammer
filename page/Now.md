## Working as a classroom assistant

After volunteering and substituting at my daughter's Montessori school for the past year, I was offered a full-time position as the classroom assistant for the elementary classroom. It was an immediate yes, as I adore Maria Montessori's philosophy, and volunteering to help with the robotics club in the fall of 2022 made me fall head over heels in love with elementary/middle-school aged kids. They're whip-smart and hilarious in ways I didn't know was possible in child. Since I've accepted the position, I've been working through Maria Montessori's writing by working through The Montessori Series{% sidenote 'sn-reading-maria' 'I am currently on the first book in the series, _The Absorbent Mind_, which is a slog to get through. Her writing is dense. â€” **JRM, March 31, 2023**' %} by the Montessori-Pierson Publishing Company, who maintains/cares for and the publishing rights to all of Maria's work. 

## Committing to writing for 100 days

I have bounced from one writing platform to another for years; I haven't been fully committed since the days of LiveJournal, when I wrote almost daily for years while in high school and college. I promised myself that I would commit to this website by writing 100 words for 100 days{% sidenote 'sn-writing-commitment' 'I am posting updates on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amorfatimami)' %}. I even tweaked my blog entries slightly, to display the total number of words written in each post, to keep me publically accountable (to the one person who might stumble upon this site ðŸ‘‹).

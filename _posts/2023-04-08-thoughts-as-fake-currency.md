...if someone were to hand you a hundred-dollar bill, you might rub it between your fingers or hold it up to the light, just to confirm it wasn't fake.

All this for an imaginary currency, an invention of society. The point of this metaphor is to highlight how much effort we put into making sure money is real, whereas we accept potentially life-changing thoughts or assumptions without so much as a question. One ironic assumption along these lines: that having a lot of money makes you wealthy. Or that because a lot of people believe something, it must be true

Ryan Holiday seems to be specifically referring to believing the thoughts and opinions of others, but the first thing that popped into my head was how quickly I believe my _own_ thoughts and feelings. That if I think it, it must true. Or, if I don't consciously accept it as true, it must be, at the very least, worthy of my attention, consideration, and time. Something that comes up a lot whenever I'm reading Brad Warner's various books on Zen philosophy is that our thoughts are ultimately just noise, that our brain will keep on thinking thoughts whether we want it to or not, and part of meditation is training yourself to treat these thoughts as no more important or unimportant than the last thought we had. None of them carry more weight than others. In meditation, you treat them like clouds: those thoughts are just passing by. Nothing less, nothing more. Easier said than done to not hang on every word of every thought we have. My thoughts consume me in the worst of moods. I spiral and a family tree of anxiety, nightmares, and misery branches out from my core. 

I think journaling and keeping a planner are ways I try to separate myself from these thoughts, to look at them from a distance, like a pretty rock I'd pick up off the sideway. I don't know if it always works. Sometimes I wonder if journaling makes it worse, as I get stuck in negative thought pattern and the awful stories I tell myself about who I am and what I am capable of (or not). I have to consciously stop myself when I find myself doing this, and it happens... a lot. Often, right in the middle of a handwritten journal entry, I will actually write out my process of regaining control of the train, forcing myself to be gentle with myself. I talk to myself in my journal as if though I were my mother, and writer Amie McNee refers to this as the act of _mothering yourself_. I just swoop in and write to myself more gently. Self-compassion doesn't come to me naturally and feels overly saccharine when I do itâ€”being nice to myself, for some reason, feels really phony. Disingenuous. Letting go of a heinous cycle of thoughts feels the same way. If I let go, I will fall apart at the seams and I'll never get anything done. I have to flagellate myself.

Tell me what you pay attention to and I will tell you who you are

Trying to spend more of my personal resources—attention, time, money—thinking about the things that I like, want to see more of, enjoy, etc. and not things that I don't. Sounds simple in principle, but I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle because it goes against the way my very human brain is wired. Bad things in life tend to stick around longer than the good things because if you remember the bad things, you're more likely to survive. I can see it in my journals, the contents largely fueled by depression and anger and feelings of failures. I can tell when I was going through particularly good phases in my life because of their notable abscence in my writing. If I went months without writing, I was probably having a good time. The one exception may be the first year of motherhood when I was struggling to survive while keeping a very, _very_ tiny human alive—sitting down to navel gaze on paper was a luxury.

## garbage in, garbage out

for anyone trying to discern what to do w/ their life: PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO. that's pretty much all the info u need.

I'm trying to adjust the flow of stimuli in my life, where it comes from and where it's getting redirected to. I liberally block and mute people on social media, and I've even turned off retweets for several people I follow: I love their original content but they retweet a lot of garbage (I still really like you! I probably retweet garbage too!). In meatspace, I'm trying to open a book before I open Reddit and I try to open my text editor of choice before I open the browser. I'm getting picky about my books, which is why I've been trying to read old books (see my entry on [building personal density](https://diewunderkammer.co/blog/building-personal-density))

## what i've been paying attention to

I'll put my money where my mouth is and share some of the things I've been reading or revisiting frequently:

1. [This Twitter thread on ambition](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1451147667732525063) by [@visakanv](https://twitter.com/visakanv) {% sidenote 'sn-rent-free' 'This thread lives rent-free in my head; I think about it a lot when considering my actions and whether or not they align with my goals' %}
2. Montaigne's _Complete Essays_
3. Maria Montessori's _The Discovery of the Child_ (partially for professional development, partially because I'm a Montessori fangirl)
4. _Succession_ on HBO
5. [How to Be Cool](https://mindmine.substack.com/p/how-to-be-cool), from [@isabelunraveled](https://twitter.com/isabelunraveled)'s Substack
6. _At the Existentialist Cafe_, by Sarah Bakewell {% sidenote 'sn-sarah-bakewell' 'Her books are some of my favorite philosophy reads. Her book on Montaigne, _How to Live_, should be on everyone&#39;s bookshelf, right next to a copy of Montaigne&#39;s essays' %}
7. _The History of Western Philosophy_, by Bertrand Russell

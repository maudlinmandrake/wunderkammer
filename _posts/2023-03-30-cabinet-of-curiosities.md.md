Very fond of the name of my new domain. Wunderkammer: "room of wonder", also called a cabinet of curiosities {% marginfigure 'mf-cabinet-of-curiosities' 'assets/illustration_of_wunderkammer.jpeg' 'The museum of Ferrante Imperato, 1599' %}: literal rooms and then cabinets dedicated to someone's junk. Magical junk. Junk that made a bunch of old white dudes go "Fuck man that's cool." They were the precursor to museums. Wikipedia mentions how the Royal Society really glommed onto these and had regular meetings where a member would show off their cabinet/room. They placed emphasis on learning as entertainment. I appreciate that sentiment. Learning should be fun. It should invoke wonder and awe, because this world, this universe, this existence, is fucking crazy. It's insane that any of this exists, and I don't feel I fully appreciate it. How many days have I woke up and gone "Not another day" instead of "HOLY SHIT?!" Too many. This feels like existentialism in a nutshell. The idea of Being really is wild.

I hope this website will become a way to inject awe and curiosity into my life, to help me not take this existence for granted. And to help me get my words in, and to read more. A keystone tool upon which many a desired behavior hinge on.
